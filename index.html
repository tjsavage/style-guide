          Provide a thorough overview of what the element does, and provide
          examples of common usage patterns. Format the documentation as
          markdown.
        </p>

        If the element declares a `<dom-module>`, write the documentation as
        HTML comments **immediately** preceeding that `<dom-module>`

            <link rel="import" href="../polymer/polymer.html">

            <!--
            `<awesome-sauce>` injects a healthy dose of awesome into your page.

            In typical use, just slap some `<awesome-sauce>` at the top of your body:

                <body>
                  <awesome-sauce></awesome-sauce>

            Wham! It's all awesome now!
            -->
            <dom-module id="awesome-sauce">

        Note that the doc comment should be **after** any dependencies.

        If your element lacks a `<dom-module>`, write documentation via a JSDoc
        comment attached to its `Polymer()` call:

            /**
             * `<awesome-sauce>` injects a healthy dose of awesome into your page.
             *
             * In typical use, just slap some `<awesome-sauce>` at the top of your body:
             *
             *     <body>
             *       <awesome-sauce></awesome-sauce>
             *
             * Wham! It's all awesome now!
             */
            Polymer({
              is: 'awesome-sauce',

        Element-level can be added at the **end** of the element summary, as part of the same comment block.
        Two tags are supported currently:

        *   `@hero`. Specifies a hero image.

                @hero path/to/image

        *   `@demo`. Specifies the path to a demo, with optional description.

                @demo demo/index.html

                @demo path/to/demo1  Super cool demo, with sharks!
                @demo path/to/demo2  Even cooler demo. The sharks have lasers!

        Other tags will be ignored.

        **Note: Any tags placed _before_ the end of the comment block are interpreted as the end
        of the element summary.**

        <p class="tldr">
          Document all public properties. Docs should start with a one line
          summary. Make sure that the property's type is annotated.
        </p>

        For example, the most simple property documentation can be a single
        line:

            /** Whether this element is currently awesome. */
            isAwesome: Boolean,

        If the property doesn't specifiy a type, or that type is not primitive,
        be sure to [annotate](#type-annotation) the type properly:

            /**
             * Metadata describing what has been made awesome on the page.
             *
             * @type {{elements: Array<HTMLElement>, level: number}}
             */
            sauce: Object,

        Private properties should be prefixed with `_`

            /** @return {string} An awesome message */
            _getMessage: function() {

          Follow the [property guidelines](#properties). Additionally, make sure
          the types for all params and return values are documented.
        </p>

        For example:

            /**
             * Applies awesomeness to `element`.
             *
             * @param {HTMLElement} element The element to be made awesome.
             * @param {number} level The numeric level of awesomeness. A value
             *     between `1` and `11`.
             * @param {Array<HTMLElements>=} refs Optional referenced elements
             *     that become awesome by proxy.
             * @return {number} The cumulative level of awesomeness.

        </p>

        Event properties are documented with the `@param` tag, just like method parameters.

        For example:

            /**
             * Fired when `element` changes its awesomeness level.
             *
             * @event awesome-change

      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">

        Include a behavior summary, just like an element summary, but ending with a
        `@polymerBehavior` tag. The behavior name can be specified explicitly if the
        doc parser is unable to infer it correctly.

            @polymerBehavior MyOddBehavior

        Document methods, properties, etc. just like an element.

        For example:

            /**
             * Behavior that highlights stuff.
             *

          When in doubt, keep to the 3rd person present tense and keep it
          simple.
        </p>

        A few guidelines for consistency:

        * Use the 3rd person for descriptions.

          * Good. "Creates a foo."
          * Avoid. "Create a foo."

          Use 2nd person ("Do this...") when you're _trying_ to be prescriptive,
          such as, "**Add** the `toolbar` attribute to the element you want
          to use as a toolbar."

        * Use the present tense whenever possible.

          * Good. "Clicking the element starts an animation."
          * Avoid. "Clicking the element will start an animation."

        * Start method descriptions with an active verb.

          * Good. "Starts the animation."
          * Avoid. "This method to starts the animation."

        * It's OK to use a fragment, especially in a short description.

          * Good. "Item height, in pixels."
          * Avoid. "This property specifies the item height, in pixels."

          (Fragments should still start with a capital letter and
          have ending punctuation.)

        The [JavaDoc Style Guide](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#styleguide)
        is a good resource on general API doc style. Most of the style rules
        described there can be applied here as well.

      <a is="sg-header">Keywords</a>

      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">
          The `keywords` property should be filled out with an array of keywords for each `bower.json` file.
        </p>

        The keywords used should be consistent across elements. All elements should have the keywords:

        - `web-components`
        - `polymer`

        Additional primary keywords to use are:

        - `wrapper` - any element that wraps another library
        - `input` - any element that takes user input
        - `textarea` - any element that provides a large textarea input
        - `a11y` - any element that helps with accessibility
        - `data` - any element that retrieves or deals with data
        - `container` - any element explicitly meant to contain other elements
        - `icon` - anything related to an icon
        - `media` - any element that helps display media
        - `storage` - any element that helps with storage
        - `control` - any element that provides a UI control - checkbox, slider, etc.
        - `overlay` - any element that provides a visual overlay
        - `responsive` - any element that is specifically responsive
        - `layout` - any element meant to help lay out a page
        - `menu` - an element that is menu-related
        - `service-worker` - any element that uses a service worker

        In addition to this set, you may add additional keywords as you see fit. Try to use general terms that could exist across multiple elements. If you notice a keyword appearing across elements that is not listed above, feel free to file a PR to this repo to add it.

        Do NOT use any of the following for keywords:

        - The name of the element
        - The product line name that the element is in
        - `web-component` (singular)
